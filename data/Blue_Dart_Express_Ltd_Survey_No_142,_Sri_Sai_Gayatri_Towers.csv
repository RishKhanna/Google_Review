1,"Wrost service delivery... 0 rating is not there so I gave 1.   They said courier went out for delivery morning and at the end of the day, they are simply saying Street in mentioned address is not known. THEY ARE NOT EVEN CALLING ONCE and simply return the courier back.  This was happened 2 days continuously. Please try to call customer if you have any query instead of returning the courier.  It will save lot of time and money to both of us. Please improve your service with this feedback",1.0,Relavent

22,Worst service that I have ever seen. They are updating online as location unavailable without calling me to deliver the courier. When I ask customer service they are saying the delivery guys contact will not given to customers. Without communication between customer and the delivery guys how can they assure that the location is not available. Where the other delivery services like speed post ems will contact the customer to deliver the courier. The courier services should be user friendly with customers by improving the communication with delivery guys.............one star rating also west to this courier service.........,1.0,Relavent

24,"One star is the least in the options else they should get in negative. Worst service ever.. i had couriered important documents with blue dart 2 weeks ago(domestic parcel)..but the courier is not yet delivered. The customer care is so bad,they will put you on hold for like 10 minutes and then phone will disconnect.. and i dont know what their delivery team does.. from past 4 days i am being told that the address is not updated in the system.. m getting it updated almost everyday yet parcel is not delivered. Shut your office down if you cannot cater to your clients",1.0,Relavent
25,"I used the express service here to ship something up another city, twice so far. It's a little expensive, but my stuff has always reached on time. And it takes her little time for the process to ship something. Will go here again if I want to ship stuff.",5.0,Relavent
26,"One of the worst experiences you will ever have. They got paid for time bound delivery for delivery by 12:30 p.m next day. The package was not delivered the entire day. There is no way you can reach their delivery guy, there is no way you can even reach them even over call or over customer care as the call disconnects after waiting for 10 long minutes. Cannot be trusted at all. I am looking to inform the concerned ministry and ensure that strict action is taken against them
For breach of trust and callous nature.",1.0,Relavent

31,"Stupidity at its Best. Few months ago I gave 5 star rating. It was my mistake. As I am working in night shift I was not able to collect the parcel at my office. I travelled from my house to collect the parcel near blue dart office. They have the parcel with them, but they say that they only deliver at office and I should be there by 5:30. Even though I have all the ID card, they are refusing to give me my courier. What kind of service is this. Stupid management.",1.0,Relavent

My bank sent my ATM card via bluedart . The bluedart service didn't even bother to call or enquire but updated delivery status as ""consignee not available"" for multiple days. I called customer support and asked if I could come to collect it with ID proof. They said they won't be handing over the parcel by hand. It will be returned back to bank after 7 days.
