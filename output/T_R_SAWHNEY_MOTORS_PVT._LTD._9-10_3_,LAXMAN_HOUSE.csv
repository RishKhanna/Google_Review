8,"Pathetic experience from this dealer.. Bought new car 3 months ago and didn‚Äôt receive the registration certificate till date.
They just do false commitments.

You may be doing well in sales but are you aware that your dealers like T.R. Sawhney Motors are spoiling your brand reputation by delivering the worst and fraudulent services ever.
I recently bought an XL6 from T R Sawhney and look at the series of blunders they did
1. They were going to install a wrong spoiler on my car and even did the marking with an iron Rod. It was fortunate they realised that it's a wrong accessory just before putting the holes
2. They sent my car registration documents to a wrong RTO office
3. They got a wrong address registered on my RC resulting in major issues and now I am stuck to know how it will be rectified

I advice you to look at these concerns on a serious note before more customers are harrased and you loose your market value. I have already spoken to their Managing Director with the hope that he will intervene Rahul Sawhney",1.0,Relavent
